# Markdown Previewer

An old project built in the first half of 2025 as the start of my journey and posted here to attach to the course's page and to preserve my path.

This project is a part of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification. The goal is to build a Markdown Previewer that allows users to write Markdown in an editor and see the rendered HTML output in real-time.

## 📋 Project Requirements
